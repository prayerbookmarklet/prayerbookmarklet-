ok this is a small project between 2 people working on a unbeleavly good book marklet the 2 devs are joespeed =)#2813 and Ant-_-#0222 i joespeed know quite a bit of javascript and ant knows css and stuff he will be learning javascript and over time this bookmarklet will just get better and better while he jets better and better at javascript.

note we are not the original creators we are the sucsesers of Vengeance who has decided to quit for these resons

Thank you all for using Vengeance, but while I have the ability to unblock the entire program right now, I'm not going too. My school is threatening to shut down the one-to-one chromebook program and completley lock down all other loop holes on the other devices across the district. I have insider info and I know that they're aren't bluffing. They can patch every single loophole, yet they choose not to for the sake of teachers losing tools for education. If I continue to exploit these loopholes, many elective classes and clubs across the district will cease to exist while normal classes will lose many important tools. I advise anyone looking for loopholes to stop and think about the consequences. I'm done with loopholes and I'm leaving the community. I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't.

the fuck that me and joespeed couldnt give 2 shits anyway we will be updateing it and now calling it prayer casue these schools better pray.
